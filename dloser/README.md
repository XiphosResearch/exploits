# D-Link DNS-320/330/350/x Remote Root Exploit v1.1
Old exploit I found on one of my old boxes that I put together for a demo. Bug was found by "imax" when he actually bought one of these NAS devices, and we ended up writing exploits for it. Dunno if its unpatched, it was still 0day last time I checked but the shit device is out of support anyway so who cares.

This exploit has been shared around a fair bit in the past, and probably has seen some actual in the wild use, so figured it was time to kill it dead.

"callback.php" is the PentestMonkey reverse shell, stripped of some bits and such so that it works reliably.
